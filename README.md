An app that I would love to build is a mobile game that is completely AI generate. This is an ambiguous idea, but all users would start off in a few predefined biomes and the world around them would generate according to AI. The world elements include aritificial generation of landscape, buildings, NPCs, etc. The features of this app would require a UI that retrieves AI generated game data and then generates that within the game for the user. The app would need basic game controls of movement, either a pad on screen or anywhere touch movement. It would also require a menu for in game settings of visuals, render settings, audio, music, sfx, etc. 

## Notes

I had to redo this project twice because the first time I created it using Mac simulator and the second time something in AppDelegate prevented the project from loading the changeColor function in.
